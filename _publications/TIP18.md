excerpt: 'In this paper, we present a thorough analysis of several aspects that impact on the use of DCNN for face recognition. The evaluation has been carried out from two main perspectives: the network architecture and the similarity measures used to compare deeply learned features; and the data (source and quality) and their preprocessing (bounding box and alignment). The results obtained on the IARPA Janus Benchmark-A, MegaFace, UMDFaces, and YouTube Faces data sets indicate viable hints for designing, training, and testing DCNNs.'

In this paper, we present a thorough analysis of several aspects that impact on the use of DCNN for face recognition. The evaluation has been carried out from two main perspectives: the network architecture and the similarity measures used to compare deeply learned features; and the data (source and quality) and their preprocessing (bounding box and alignment). The results obtained on the IARPA Janus Benchmark-A, MegaFace, UMDFaces, and YouTube Faces data sets indicate viable hints for designing, training, and testing DCNNs.
