In our method, swapping parts from a source face to a target one is performed by fitting a 3D prior, which establishes dense pixels correspondence between parts, while also handling pose differences.'

. In this paper, we propose
to swap facial parts as a way to disentangle the recognition
relevance of different face parts, like eyes, nose and mouth.
In our method, swapping parts from a source face to a target
one is performed by fitting a 3D prior, which establishes dense
pixels correspondence between parts, while also handling pose
differences. Seamless cloning is then used to obtain smooth
transitions between the mapped source regions and the shape and
skin tone of the target face. We devised an experimental protocol
that allowed us to draw some preliminary conclusions when the
swapped images are classified by deep networks, indicating a
prominence of the eyes and eyebrows region. [Download paper here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.11759.pdf)
