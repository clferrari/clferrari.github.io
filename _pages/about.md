I am currently tenure-track assistant professor (RTT) at the Department of Information Engineering and Mathematics of the University of Siena.

Previously, I have been a assistant professor (RTT) at the Department of Engineering and Architecture of the University of Parma, working with the IMPLab led by Prof. Andrea Prati, and a PostDoc researcher at the Media Integration and Communication Center (MICC) of the University of Florence, working with Prof. Alberto Del Bimbo, Prof. Stefano Berretti and Prof. Pietro Pala. 

I have also been a visiting research scholar at the IRIS Lab of the Univeristy of Southern California (USC) in 2014, under the supervision of Prof. Gerard Medioni, working with Prof. Iacopo Masi.

My research activity focuses on Computer Vision and Deep Learning, with particular interest for biometrics and human analysis applications, 3D and 4D generative face and body models.
