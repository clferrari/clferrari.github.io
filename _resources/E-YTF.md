In this work, we propose an approach based on a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) for refining the coarse reconstruction provided by a 3DMM. The latter is represented as a three channels image, where the pixel intensities represent the depth, curvature and elevation values of the 3D vertices. The architecture is an encoderâ€“decoder, which is trained progressively, starting from the lower-resolution layers; this technique allows a more stable training, which leads to the generation of high quality outputs even when high-resolution images are fed during the training. Experimental results show that our method is able to produce reconstructions with fine-grained realistic details and lower reconstruction errors with respect to the 3DMM.
